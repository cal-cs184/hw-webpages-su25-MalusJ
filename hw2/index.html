		<h2>Overview</h2>
		In this homework, I implemented several fundamental mesh operations using the half-edge data structure. The tasks helped me gain a better understanding of these concepts and made me realize how cool it is to see the knowledge we learned being applied in practice. (I do feel a bit of regret for not starting this assignment earlier so my midterm grade could be much higher.)
		<h2>Section I: Bezier Curves and Surfaces</h2>

		<h3>Part 1: Bezier curves with 1D de Casteljau subdivision</h3>
		We will be using Casteljau's algorithm in this part to draw a Bezier curve. Casteljau's algorithm is a commonly used way for evaluating Bezier curves given a list of points. The algorithm works in a recursive manner. It repeatedly interpolate between control points until there is only one point remain. And the last point lies on the Bezier curve. The formula can be written as:<p>
$$
p'_i = \text{lerp}(p_i, p_{i+1}, t) = (1 - t)p_i + t p_{i+1}
$$
</p>Given a list of n control points,p<sub>1</sub>, p<sub>2</sub>, ... p<sub>n</sub> and the parameter t. This is also how it is implemented in my code. It started with the original control points, and then iteratively perform linear interpolation and push back the new points created. The algorihtm ends when the vector only has one point, which is the point on the Bezier curve at parameter t.
</p>

		<p>I will demonstrate the result with a customized 6-degree bezier curve and show how it works differently with a different parameter t and moved control points. The red dot represents the final point.</p>

		<h3>Part 2: Bezier surfaces with separable 1D de Casteljau</h3>
		<p>By repeatedly applying Casteljau's algorithm we are able to extend the algorithm and evalueate a 2D Bezier surface. We first evaluate the rows of control points at parameter u to get the intermediate points, then we evaluate these points at parameter v to obtain the final points on the 2D Bezier surface!
		</p>
		<p>To implement this, I first created a 1D evalution function similar to what we have for the 1D Bezier curve. This function wil be used another function that calls it on each row to get the u-direction intermediate points, and calls it again to compute the final points for the surface.</p>

		<h2>Section II: Triangle Meshes and Half-Edge Data Structure</h2>

		<h3>Part 3: Area-weighted vertex normals</h3>
		To compute area-weighted vertex normals, the half-edge data structure is used. The algorithm iterate through all faces that are connected to the vertex with the half-edge data structure. Starting from the vertex's associated half-edge, it repeatedly move to the opposite half-edge on the neighboring face and then go to the next half-edge of that face. By doing this process, we are able to circle around the vertex until we return to the starting half-edge.
		<p>And to comput the normal, for each of the non-boundry face we take the three vertices, and we calculatethe face area. Then we multiply the face's normal by the area. Finally, we sum up the area-weighted normals for all the incident faces and normalize the result to get the final value.</p>
		<p>We will present the effect with and without vertex normals:</p>

		<h3>Part 4: Edge flip</h3>
		Edge flip is an operation that changes the shared edge between two adjacent triangles. It removes the shared edge and connects the previously opposite vertices. This operation effectively flips the diagonal of the quadrilateral formed by the two triangles. To implement this, I check first that if the edge is on the boundary since boundary edges cannot do this operation. Then I gathered all the information of the halfedges, next, twin, vertex, edge, and face. And finally, I updated the reference halfedges of the vertices, and the corresponding vertices and faces. One method I used in this implementation is actually draw many half edges structure on a pape, label them, to keep track of them since writing in code could be messy and hard to keep track of.  It also helped during debugging, as I could trace the labels on the diagram to quickly locate where the issue might be.

		</div>
		While I was implementing the code for the flipEdge function, there was one point that a bug caused the the mesh the behave strangely, that the triangle disappeared completely and my result looks like the stormtrooper from star war. Later after carefully tracing through my hand written diagram, I find out this is caused by a single typo in variable name.

		<h3>Part 5: Edge split</h3>
		Edge Split is an operation that inserts a new vertex on the midpoint of an existing edge, dividing it into two edges and forming two new triangles. This operation effectively splits the shape with two adjacent triangles into four smaller triangles. Very similar to what I did in the previous task, I first checked whether the edge is on boundary since boundary edges cannot be flipped(not attempting extra credit). Then I gather all the information needed from related half edges, their next and twins as well as the corresponding vertices edges and faces. Then I create the new vertex, edges, half edges and faces, and update all the pointers. Unlike the previosu task, edge split involves a lot of newly created edges, half edges, faces and vertices compared to the previous one. So I used a strategy in naming to keep things organized. Instead of naming the newly created variabels in sequence with the existing ones. I added the word "new" in front of them to clearly distinguish them, which made debugging much easier.

		<h3>Part 6: Loop subdivision for mesh upsampling</h3>
		Loop subdivison is an operation that first upsamples a mesh by subdividing each triangle into four smaller triangle and then smoothing the mesh by updating vertex positions to produce a smoother surface. The operation is commonly used to create higher resolution smooth approximation of the existing meshes. To implement this I followed the five steps in spec:
		<ul>
					<li><b>Computing Original Vertices' New Position:</b> I first computed the new positions for all original vertices using the formula based on their neighoring vertices. And I mark them as old vertices with the given bool <i>Vertex::isNew</i> flag(value false).</li>
					<li><b>Computing Updated Vertex Positions:</b>Then I computed the new positions for edge midpoints and have them stored in <i>Edge::newPosition</i></li>
					<li><b>Split Every Edge in Mesh:</b> The next step is to split all the original edges one by one. For each edge, new vertex at its midpoint is created. It sets this vertex's position to the value I calcualted earlier. This new vertex is also marked with <i>Vertex::isNew</i> flag(value true). So I could tell it apart from the old vertices. The four edges connected to this new vertex are also updated. </li>
					<li><b>Flipping Edges:</b>After splliting, we go though all edges again and flipped the ones that is connected to one old vertex and one new vertex. This step is required to kep the structure evenly shaped.</li>
					<li><b>Copy New Vertex positions:</b> Finally, I update evry vertex's position to a new value, calculated by copying the stored newPosition into Position. And we are done with loop subdivision!</li>
				</ul>
		<p><b>The following is my observation for loop subdivision:</b></p>
		<p>After the subdivision, the mesh definitely becomes smoother and rounder, just as exptected. And I notice that sharp corners and edges would quickly become rounded because that vertices are pulled toward the averge of their neighbors. The effect could be slightly reduced by pre-splitting edges near sharp feature before subdivision. We will use a set of comparison in the following examples.</p>

			  <p>As we can see above, mesh has become smoother. But at the same time, it might lost some information regarding the shape. I intentionally selected example 2 and example 2 with a edge flip which represents a hard feature on the side to compare. After a few loop subdivision, both results looked almost the same which is not desirable in some scenarios.This reminds that although loop subdivision is a powerful tool to increase quality, we still need to use it wisely and choose how much we want to do it.</p>

		<p>To discover whether you can reduce the effect by pre-splitting some edges, I compared the same cube with different split/flip on each side. The original cube with two trianlges tend to be asymmetric after a few loop subdivision, which was caused by the uneven asymmetric split/flip on each side. I then adjusted the split and make it asymmetric. The result was a perfectly symmetric cube. This shows that pre-splitting does affect the outcome of loopsubdivion, as it can influence how mesh smooths and make reasult appear more/less uniform depending on the way you pre-split the edge.</p>
